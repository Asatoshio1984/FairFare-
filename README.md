# FairFare-
FairFare â€“ A rideshare cost calculator that helps Lyft and Uber drivers see their real earnings after expenses. It factors in gas, maintenance, and depreciation costs while using OCR to scan ride offers. Drivers set a minimum wage, and the app instantly tells them whether to accept or reject a ride, preventing unfair pay. ðŸš—ðŸ’°
