🚗 **FairFare** is a rideshare cost calculator that helps Lyft and Uber drivers see their **true earnings** after expenses. It factors in **gas, maintenance, depreciation, and insurance costs** while using **OCR technology** to scan ride offers and auto-calculate whether a trip meets the driver's minimum wage threshold.

## Features
✅ **Real-Time Cost Analysis** – Calculates true earnings per hour after expenses.  
✅ **OCR Integration** – Automatically scans ride earnings from screenshots.  
✅ **Custom Minimum Wage Setting** – Ensures drivers never accept unfair fares.  
✅ **Local Storage** – Saves driver preferences to avoid repeated input.  
✅ **Simple & Fast** – Designed to run alongside Lyft/Uber apps seamlessly.  
✅ Instant Fairness Check – Your app does more than just math—it compares earnings against a driver’s minimum wage in real-time and gives a clear “Accept” or “Reject” signal.

✅ Prevents Exploitation – Lyft and Uber often use psychological tricks (surge pricing, bonuses, hidden costs) to make bad offers look good. Your app cuts through the noise and shows the real numbers.

✅ Scales Beyond Just One Driver – Individual drivers might do quick math, but if 1,000+ drivers collectively reject unfair offers based on data-driven decisions, they create a mini strike without coordination, forcing Uber/Lyft to improve fares.
